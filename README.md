# Coffee Break
## All students need their coffee

### Game Concept
The chosen theme is a dungeon crawler set in FEUP's campus at night. Its goal is to “simply” get a cup of coffee.
The main mechanics of the game are:
Collect coins, cups of coffee, one student card and multiple objects.
Use objects to distract guards, by throwing them and making a noise, attracting them or make the floor dirty and attract the cleaning ladies.
The player can get caught up to 3 times by the guards and get away with it by giving excuses for being at FEUP that late. When caught a 4th time, it’s game over.

### Proposed Game Engine
The group plans on using Unity to develop the prototype (and demo).

### Main Challenges
Playing as a regular student, the main challenges are:
Collect enough coins (30 coins or 25 + a cup) to order a coffee.
Collect the student card to open certain doors.
Clear the way of the cleaning ladies and avoid being caught by the security guards.
