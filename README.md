# Coffee Break
## A quest for coffee

### Game Concept
The chosen theme is a dungeon crawler set in FEUP's campus at night. Its goal is to “simply” get a cup of coffee.
The main mechanics of the game are:
1. Collect coins, cups of coffee and one student card. 
2. Sacrifice coins to distract guards, by throwing them and making a noise, attracting them or or tip over trash bins in order to attract the cleaning ladies.
3. The player can get caught up to 3 times by the guards and get away with it by giving excuses for being at FEUP that late. When caught a 4th time, it’s game over.
4. The player can walk or sprint (or walks slowly), where sprinting can make noise that can alert the guards

### Main Challenges
Playing as a regular student, the main challenges are:
1. Collect enough coins (30 coins or 25 + a cup) to order a coffee.
2. Collect the student card to open certain doors.
3. Clear the way of the cleaning ladies and avoid being caught by the security guards.
