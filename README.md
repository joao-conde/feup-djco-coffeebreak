# Coffee Break - A quest for coffee :coffee:

### Motivation

"Coffee Break" was developed by [@joao-conde](https://github.com/joao-conde), [@CarlosFr97](https://github.com/CarlosFr97) and [@literallysofia](https://github.com/literallysofia) for the [Computer Games Development](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=281244) course at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.inicial).

The course professors made us choose between a platformer or a dungeon crawler game. We chose the latter.


### Game Concept

"Coffee Break" is a dungeon crawler set in FEUP's campus at night. The goal is to “simply” get a cup of coffee. This task becomes a lot harder.

In order to get to the coffee, the student must:
1. Collect enough coins (30 coins or 25 + a cup, current FEUP machine prices) to order a coffee.
2. Collect the student card to open certain doors.
3. Clear the way of the cleaning ladies .
4. Avoid being caught by the security guards.


The main mechanics of the game are:
1. Throw and sacrifice coins to distract guards, making a noise thus attracting them to other location.
2. Tip over trash bins in order to attract the cleaning ladies.
3. The player can walk normally or stealth walk. Normal walk makes noise alerting the guards that will search your location.


### Development Environment

Built for Windows, Linux and MacOS (in Builds)
