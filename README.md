Game developed by [Carlos Freitas](https://github.com/CarlosFr97), [Jo√£o Conde](https://github.com/joao-conde) and [Sofia Silva](https://github.com/literallysofia).

**Completed in 25/03/2019.**

## Game Concept

**Coffee Break** is a dungeon crawler game set in FEUP's campus at night.

During a long night of work, a cup of coffee is a must. You don't have any money, so you should collect anything you find. Make your way to the coffee machine but be aware! Don't get caught by the guards. The cleaning ladies are out there, blocking entrances and standing in your way. Be smart, and you shall be rewarded.

## Mechanics
The main mechanics of the game are:
- Collect enough coins (30 coins or 25 + a cup, current FEUP machine prices) to order a coffee.
- Collect the student card to open certain doors.
- Clear the way of the cleaning ladies: tip over trash bins in order to attract them.
- Avoid being caught by the security guards: throw and sacrifice coins to distract them, making a noise thus attracting them to other location.
- The player can walk normally or stealth walk. Normal walk makes noise alerting the guards that will search your location.
